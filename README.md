**Challenge Title**
Star Rating Component

**Description**
I built a Star Rating Component where users can select how many stars user want to give as feedback!

**Features**

- The Star Rating component should display a set of stars that can be clicked or hovered over to select a rating.
- The component should be customizable, with an option to change the number of stars to be displayed.
- When the user clicks on a star to select a rating, the rating should be updated, and a corresponding message should be displayed.
- The component should ensure that hovering over the third star after selecting the fourth star highlights only the first, second, and third stars.

**How To**

Run index.html as a server to see the component
